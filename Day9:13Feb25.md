Recomputation of RMSNorm and MLA Up-Projection. We recompute all RMSNorm operations and MLA up-projections during back-propagation, thereby eliminating the need to


Exponential Moving Average in CPU. During training, we preserve the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the model parameters for early estimation of the model performance



Shared Embedding and Output Head for Multi-Token Prediction. With the DualPipe strategy,
